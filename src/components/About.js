        <h5>Hi, I'm Cody. Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a little better.</h5> 
          <p>
            I am originally from Memphis TN, but now live in Nashville. I graduated from UT Knoxville in 2010 with a degree in Political Science, with concentrations in Literature and History. Since graduating, I have worked for organizations such as the YMCA of Memphis, Impact Printing, and Ingram Express Services. I am currently studying to become a full stack web developer, and taking advantage of opportunities as they arise. I hope you enjoy your visit to my portfolio, and thanks again for checking it out.
